1-
SELECT *
FROM customer
WHERE customer.CustomerID IN (SELECT order_.CustomerID FROM order_ WHERE order_.TotalAmount > 10000 AND order_.OrderID IN (SELECT product.ProductID FROM product WHERE product.Name != "Mouse" AND product.Name !="Keyboard"));

2-
SELECT *
FROM product
WHERE product.Name LIKE 'M%'AND product.Stock > 130;

3-
SELECT *
FROM orderitem
WHERE orderitem.OrderID IN ( SELECT order_.OrderID FROM order_
WHERE order_.CustomerID IN (SELECT customer.CustomerID FROM customer  WHERE customer.Gender ='men' AND customer.Address ='Mashhad'));

4-
SELECT *
FROM customer
INNER JOIN orderitem ON customer.CustomerID IN (SELECT order_.CustomerID FROM order_ WHERE order_.OrderID IN (SELECT orderitem.OrderID FROM orderitem) );

نسخه بهترش 
SELECT *
FROM order_
INNER JOIN orderitem ON order_.OrderID = orderitem.OrderID
INNER JOIN customer ON customer.CustomerID = order_.CustomerID;
